        <p class="project-description">
            Scrap Forge is an Isometric 3D Action-Adventure game project I was apart of as Head of Code during my 2nd year at 
            <a href="https://www.bcu.ac.uk/">BCU University</a>.
            The team spanned over 50+ members about 12 of whom were developers.
            The game is set on a forgotten planet, collapsed, unloved and filled with junk littered everywhere.
