                    Nova Zone is a take on the arcade style shmup game genre where the player progresses through an environment
                    full of progressively more difficult enemies that they need to destroy. The twist being that they can
                    sacrifice their score to acquire upgrades to make themselves more powerful. Consequently, this gives
                    the player ownership of the difficulty of the game in a way they can immediately see its impact,
                    allowing them to play it their way.

                    object-oriented programming techniques in Python for the first time. However, this project taught me
                    the limitations of designing and developing games without a game engine.</p>

                    as a hobby which I’ve made time to keep relevant to remain versatile and adaptable should I need to
                    employ them into the industry. Furthermore, I believe the knowledge I’ve gained here should allow me
                    a level of empathy when working with 3D artists to more effectively communicate and work with them.</p>
